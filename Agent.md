What we need is the rep grid analysis of this paper. 

This repertory grid analysis begins in section 3. In this section Menzies defines the repertory grid as a way to distinguish certain characteristics about an idea/object.  In the description provided a new row of dimensions is only added if it helps distinguish differences between an idea/object. Each row is identified by a dimension and has a description for each end of the spectrum. As mentioned in the paper, if an example scores ‘1’ it is near the left hand end of a dimension and if it scores a ‘5’ it is on the right hand side of a dimension.

In addition, each row holds a certain weight. When all the rows are added up the weight must equal 100. Section 3 of this paper describes each dimension as it relates to the example but unfortunately does not talk about the weights.
