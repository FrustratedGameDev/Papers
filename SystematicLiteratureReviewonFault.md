From this paper I determined that we need to have a couple Research questions we should answer. These research questions will guide our understanding of what we are looking for in papers and allow us to determine dimensions for our rep grid analysis. This paper defined criteria for prediction studies, context, model building, and data presented as assessment information.  The grouping of criteria translated to 4 phases which weeded out fail papers. This full literary review started with 2073 got cut down to 208 that were actually reviewed by people. After the review the papers were cut down to 36.

If you read this paper you can go to to read section 2 and then go to the end of section 3. There is also a chart that is shown in the beginning of section 5 that shows the phases of the refinement.
