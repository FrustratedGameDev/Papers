    * added Asian civilizations mid-development
    * 
        * not afraid to make changes
        * not afraid to get design input

    * tried to remove loopholes
    * getting the right balance in a game is hard (one player shouldn't have a lot more advantage over the others)
    * created 3D models even though only used 2D sprites
    * 
        * artists actually had better machines than devs

    * took other pains to improve art
    * generated color pallete too early in process (is this still an issue?) only had 200 some colors and was too limited.
    * lots of original performance issues
    * 
        * went from 10 fps to 55 fps!!

    * might not detect performance issues early in dev since the game isn't using much power. only later are those issues brought up.
    * useful to separate engine code from game code
    * quick communication with publisher (Microsoft) was very helpful
    * played own game for fun
    * company (Ensemble) respected the employees
    * 
        * family invited to dinners
        * time off after crunch time
        * sent flowers etc to families during crunches

    * incorporate localization early to reduce versions
    * get user feedback early
    * 
        * their beta test was too late

    * was waiting on Microsoft to ship updated graphics standards before finishing game
    * 
        * then Microsoft removed some features from the final version that this game required and had used in the beta. Company then spent extra time re-implementing the feature.

    * Automate testing!!!
