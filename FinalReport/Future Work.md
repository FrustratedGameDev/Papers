# Future Work

In defining these dimensions during the repertory grid analysis we were able to define the many ways that software development compares to games development.
This literature review provides a qualitative comparision and implies that there are multiple ways that development can be approached to achieve a product.
Implications from this work also include that there should be similar analysis to compare the amount of research approached in other software fields.
