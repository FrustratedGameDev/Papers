#Results

In this section we will discuss the results from our systematic literature review. 
This project presented us with a repertory grid that compares the dimensions defined from the review.

##Dimension Defined

##Weighted Dimensions

While defining the initial list of dimensions, the weights of the dimensions in the Repertory Grid were all divided equally across the dimensions in the grid. 
As the final grid was generated and similar dimensions were combined, the authors worked together to determine which dimensions were ranked higher than others.
During this process we valued <i>importance</i> over <i>frequency</i>.
Frequency refers to the amount of times an article discussed a dimension and importance refers to how much depth the article discussed a particular topic.

For the final repertory grid, we decided to rank them as follows:  Requirement Volatility(25) , Quality of Life(21), Creativity(16), Developer Motivation(11), Testing(9), Team Composition(9), and Autonomy from Funding(9). 
When determining the weights, the goal was to make sure that the sum of all dimensions was 100. 
In addition,  we had to determine the importance of each dimension as it compared others. 
To do this we first identified the most discussed dimensions which were found to be Requirement Volatility, Quality of Life, Creativity, and Developer Motivation as interesting factors in the literature from the game Development community. 
After carefully determining  the comparision of the high valued groups we moved onto Testing, Team Composition, and Autonomy from Funding. 
In comparison to each other, this small subset were all determined to be on the same tier. There was not distinctive information provided on these categories to give one a heavier weight than the other.

The tool 'Prioritze Concerns' feature of the Repertory Grid tool supported our adjustment of the weights. 
This feature of the tool ensured that the value of the weights always summed to 100 and reflected the difference between dimensions as discussed between colloborators.
