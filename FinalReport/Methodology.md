# Methodology
In this section we describe the process of our literature review.
First we identified a few papers that we used to seed our review.
Secondly, we used those papers to compile a list of potentially relevant papers.
We then used a set of relevancy rules to determine if those papers were relevant or not.
Throughout this process we identified a few papers as *key papers* that were indispensible in our review.
After reviewing all papers we performed a *repertory grid analysis* to help us reason about our review as a whole.
The end result are important distinctions between game development and traditional software development.


## Step 1: Determining Seed Papers
Initially our search was to review literature around the frustrations of developers caused by development environments such as Eclipse, with the intention of comparing game development environments to traditional software development environments.
We used two papers we were very familiar with: one by Murphy-Hill et al. on differences between game development and traditional software development and a second by Ko et al. on the learning barriers encountered in development. 
We shifted our focus to be more general and to review literature around game development and how it differs from traditional software development.
As a result of this focus change, we replaced the seed paper on learning barriers with a magazine article by Blow. Blow's article gave us insight into what it meant to be a game developer.
We then compiled all references from these two papers into a list of potentially relevant papers.


## Step 2: Determining Relevant Papers
We took this list of potentially relevant papers and determine which were relevant based on a set of rules we developed.
If the paper met all of the below rules then we classified it as relevant and added it to our GitHub repository.

### Relevancy Rules
1. Does the paper discuss the development process?
2. Does the paper discuss game development?
3. Does the paper discuss some form of the challenges or stress encountered by developers?
4. Does the paper provide results of some form?


## Step 3: Extracting Dimensions
Our goal is to determine what each paper is about and then compare the papers to each other.
In order to do this we extracted a *dimension* from every paper.

### Reading Abstracts
After we compiled a list of relevant papers, we read through all of the abstracts, took some notes, and added them to our GitHub repository.
On some of them, we were able to extract a dimension from just the abstract, and if so, we noted that dimension in the repository.

### Reading in Depth
If we could not extract a dimension from just the abstract, or if the paper seemed especially useful, we marked it for in depth reading. 

#### Similar Dimensions
If we extracted a dimension we had already extracted from another paper, we attempted to find another useful dimension of the paper. If no other dimension could be extracted, we considered that paper to have no significant extra contribution that was relevant to our review and we marked the paper as a dead end. 


## Step 4: Defining Key Articles
In addition to the original two seed articles, we discovered two more articles to be immensely helpful in our review. We marked all four articles as key articles for future use.

The key articles were:

1. Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?
2. Game Development: Harder Than You Think
3. The 'Console Ship is Sinking' and What this Means for Indies
4. International Game Developers Association. (2004). Quality of life white paper

### Reviewing References
We had reviewed all references of the first two key articles at the beginning of our review. When we encountered the third article we restarted from Step 1. We reviewed all references and added them to a list of potentially relevant papers. We then continued to Step 2 to determine which papers were relevant and then to Step 3 where we extracted dimensions.

The fourth article was a white paper that did not have a list of references and thus we did not cycle our process on this article.

At the end of this process we had a list of dimensions that differentiated the papers from each other.
