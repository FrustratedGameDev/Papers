# Methodology

In this section we describe the process of our literature review.
First we identified a few papers that we used to seed our review.
Secondly, we used those papers to compile a list of potentially relevant papers.
We then used a set of relevancy rules to determine if those papers were relevant or not.
Throughout this process we identified a few papers as *key papers* that were indispensible in our review.
After reviewing all papers we performed a *repertory grid analysis* to help us reason about our review as a whole.
The end result are important distinctions between game development and traditional software development.

## Determining Seed Papers
Initially our search was to review literature around the frustrations of developers caused by development environments such as Eclipse, with the intention of comparing game development environments to traditional software development environments.
We used two papers we were very familiar with: one by Murphy-Hill et al. on differences between game development and traditional software development and a second by Ko et al. on the learning barriers encountered in development. 
We shifted our focus to be more general and to review literature around game development and how it differs from traditional software development.
As a result of this focus change, we replaced the seed paper on learning barriers with a magazine article by Blow. Blow's article gave us insight into what it meant to be a game developer.
We then compiled all references from these two papers into a list of potentially relevant papers.

## Determining Relevant Papers
We took this list of potentially relevant papers and determine which were relevant based on a set of rules we developed.
If the paper met all of the below rules then we classified it as relevant and added it to our GitHub repository.

### Relevancy Rules
1. Does the paper discuss the development process?
2. Does the paper discuss game development?
3. Does the paper discuss some form of the challenges or stress encountered by developers?
4. Does the paper provide results of some form?
