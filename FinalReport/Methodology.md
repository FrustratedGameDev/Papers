# Methodology

In this section we describe the process of our literature review.
First we identified a few papers that we used to seed our review.
Secondly, we used those papers to compile a list of potentially relevant papers.
We then used a set of relevancy rules to determine if those papers were relevant or not.
Throughout this process we identified a few papers as *key papers* that were indispensible in our review.
After reviewing all papers we performed a *repertory grid analysis* to help us to reason about our review as a whole.
The end result is a small repertory grid that we have refined to highlight important distinctions between game development and traditional software development.
