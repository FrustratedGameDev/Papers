The dimensions as defined in our results have found to be encouraged differently across the development community.
For example, Requirement Volatility amongst general software developers in comparison to games developers. 
Since fun and engagement, can be very hard to define[cite] for varied environments it affects the development process greatly in games. 
When creating a game this is something that can change at any stage in creating the game and the stress relies on games developers to ensure that it exists.
Fun and engagement is a high priority for the games industry as it is what encourages the revenue from product users.
In general software developement, requirements can be flexible in the agile process[cite:creator of agile] and can be modified with iterative rollouts of a product. The iterative development process in games varies as planned crunches are approached.

Another example of how a dimension can vary across the development community is creativity.
The creativity versus constructivism spectrum compares the value of fostering the natural ability to create art versus the ability to build upon what has already been done.
This spectrum defines part of the process to building an amazing product.
In this literature review, the games industry placed a higher price tag on the art of game making.
This art is valued in general software development but on a completly different scale. The reason for this could be the multitude of art directed industries that are similar to games, such as movie production, and  music video production.
Most games have a narrative; a story that is told often without explicitly stating it. 
In general software development this art is not valued on the same tier as other industries with a narrative. 
The constructivism of code reuse as a starting point is the approach in general software development where efficiency is a charactersistic of art. 

This repertory grid analysis provides many implications for further research in games development.
Through completing this analysis it has been a found that there needs to be a call for more research into the lifestyle of games developers. 
A key paper from our literature reivew[cite:Murphy, Cowboys] has been recognized by the community as a step in the right direction but there is more to be done. 
There is more to the development of games than the design process. 
A detailed review of the design process would present how the design process in games affects the developers. 
Just as previous researchers have refined what and how the social aspects of being a developer modifies the process[cite:programmer interrupted, exploring frustration, some SO study], we expect this paper to encourage the same for the games industry.
As an industry that is so similar and highly valued, the games industry will benefit highly from a deeper analysis of the games lifestyle.
