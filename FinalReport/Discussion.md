# Discussion

- acknowledging each(or many) dimensions and how it varies from games vs software developers
- implication: 
 - should be more research into the lifestyle of games developers
 - theres a lot of that for software developers( i.e. programmer interrupted, frustration of software, StackOverflow) but theres not a lot for games. This study shows that.  and there should be more for games because its different
 - maybe even define some potential studies for games developers



The dimensions as defined in our results have found to be encouraged differently across the development community.



This repertory grid analysis provides many implications for further research in games development.
Through completing this analysis it has been a found that there needs to be a call for more research into the lifestyle of games developers. 
A key paper from our literature reivew[cite:Murphy, Cowboys] has been recognized by the community as a step in the right direction but there is more to be done. 
There is more to the development of games than the design process. 
A detailed review of the design process would present how the design process in games affects the developers. 
Just as previous researchers have refined what and how the social aspects of being a developer modifies the process[cite:programmer interrupted, exploring frustration, some SO study], we expect this paper to encourage the same for the games industry.
As an industry that is so similar and highly valued, the games industry will benefit highly from a deeper analysis of the games lifestyle.
