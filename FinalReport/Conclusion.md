#Conclusion

In this paper we discussed the benefits of repertory grid analysis and the great information that can be depcited from them. 
From previous systematic literature reviews we were able to see that by navigating through the literature a research area can be identified as valuable. 
In our study we identified papers that identified the frustrations of a games developer. 
Through this review of the literature we were able to define and finalize 6 distinct dimensions: Requirement Volatility, Developer Motivation, Creativity, Team Composition, Autonomy for Funding, and Quality of Life. 
These dimensions that we have defined have outlined implications that can affect both games developers and software developers.
One of these implications lead to expanding this Repertory Grid Analysis to the comparison of software developers and games developers.
