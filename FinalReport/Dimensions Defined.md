##Dimensions Defined
===

### Requirement Volatility

   Requirement volatility describes how often the requirements of a project change. This dimension was inspired by agile and waterfall comparison of iterative development. The process of which products are developed vary across the companies. In some circumstances the process if fully up to the team, for others it comes from upper management.
   
### User Interactions

   - user challenge & user emotion & user fun & user engagement & user impact
   - social interaction - Could be posed as a question at the end of the section.
      - changed the way people game. the game continues to be played even when a specific user is missing. the same way conversations continue when someone leaves.
   - Anthony has official quote somewhere
   
### Testing
 - unit testing vs system testing & is there testing vs.no testing
 - can be defined overall do they have a lot of testing or just a little bit. What kind?
 
### Motivation
   - combines entertainmen-solve problem dimension
   - could also mention a bit of the user impact dimension
   - what is the game for: entertainment or to solve problem and how does that effect the developer's interest?
   - people are interested in the art of creating games just as they are interested in the are of creating computer programs.
   
### Creativity
   
   Creativity refers to the encouragement of developers to start from scratch with a project versus building on top of a current codebase. This spectrum from creativity to constructivism varies upon audience addressed in the project.

### Team composition
   - combine: high dev interaction vs low dev interaction  & team composition(team member movement aka "Anthony calls it viscosity") & multiple discipline teams vs individual discipline teams
   - also add organizational hierarchy: discuss it as close to fluid team movement. Fluid management

### Funding
   - traditional funding() vs crowdfunding
   - spectrum: 1 receiving funding from company .........3 partial crowdfunding...........5 raising money on own
   - Possibly add another one underthis: how responsible/accountable the company is for its product
      - ex. (1) oracle buying all of teklec and running teklec as oracle vs. (2)oracle and teklec running simultaneously and the name are one in the same vs. (3)Teklec living their life and happen to get funding from Oracle. Oracle still does not run any part of the show.
   
### Crunch
   
   Crunch defines the time period before a shipping of a project where the developers are expected to work long hours. 
   The length of the crunch varies across product. Extended crunches often lead to "Death Marches" where developers are too tired to produce quality code.

### Job Stability
	
   Job stability is something that is very important in today's society. As developers are humans and have families and lifestyles to support, it becomes more evident that job stability is valued. Across different industries, developers can expect a varied time period to be employed. Some industried have an expected risk associated with them, which often attracts employees.
   
### Turnover
   	
   Developers can easily get fed up with the work envrionments. This can cause them to leave their companies at high rates after staying at the company for a short amount of time resulting in high turnover. Low turnover can be defined as high retention rates for the company. 

### Work Ownership
		
   As a developer, it feels good to be acknowledged for the hardwork, responsibility, and accountability that is put into a product. This can be characterized as high work ownership. When a developer is not acknowledged for their contributions or made responsibile for their portion of a project  this can be characterized as low work ownership.

### Size
	
   The size of a system constitutes of 3 aspects: (1) The number of develpers working on a product, (2) the complexity of a product's features, and (3) number of users for a product. All of these factors can contribute to the stress of a developer. As each of these aspects of size increase so does the activities of a devloper.
