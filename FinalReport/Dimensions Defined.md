##Dimensions Defined
===

### Requirement Volatility

   Requirement volatility describes how often the requirements of a project change. This dimension was inspired by agile and waterfall comparison of iterative development. The process of which products are developed vary across the companies. In some circumstances the process if fully up to the team, for others it comes from upper management.
   
### Testing
 
   During the process of the literature review it was found that there are circumstances where products have little to no documented testing strategy. Testing a product (both unit testing and system testing) is apart of the process of developing products to ensure that the user receives the best experience and continue to use the product. This dimension identifies whether there is a tesing framework in place.
 
### Developer Motivation
#### User Interactions

   The interactions of the users of the product can change the approach of how the product is approached. If the developers know that the users would use the product as a learning tool the developers are inclined to feel more connected to the product. In oppositon, if the developers feel as though the product is for mere entertainment of the user they can be less inclined to contribute their efforts to the product. Making the developers aware of the challenges, emotions, levels of fun, and engagement that the user will come incontact with can produce a more motivated developer. These motivated developers create amazing products that they can be proud of.

#### Work Ownership
		
   As a developer, it feels good to be acknowledged for the hardwork, responsibility, and accountability that is put into a product. This can be characterized as high work ownership. When a developer is not acknowledged for their contributions or made responsibile for their portion of a project  this can be characterized as low work ownership.
   
### Creativity 
   
   Creativity refers to the encouragement of developers to start from scratch with a project versus building on top of a current codebase. This spectrum from creativity to constructivism varies upon audience addressed in the project.

### Team composition

   There are many aspects of a team that are covered in this dimension: (1) the variation of interactions between the team- having many interactions to none at all, (2) the viscosity - how often the developers switch teams, and (3) the number of projects a team may handle. These apects of a team have been defined on a spectrum of being dynamic to static. Fluid team movements is an example of an organizational hierarchy where all employees(management and developers) are able to flexible in their work and the company fully supports their movement as long as its productive.

### Autonomy for Funding

   The traditional funding source for projects has been funding from venture captilalists and other investors who are intersted in receiving some return from the product such as being a valued stakeholder of the company. Recently, crowdfunding has been trending as a way to receive donated money with no strings attached, eventhough it may not complete all the finacial needs of the company. 
   You can consider this spectrum as how much  responsibility and accountability a company has over its own product. An example of this is Oracle as major mogul and Teklec being thesmall company: (1) Oracle buying all of Teklec and running teklec as Oracle v.s. (2) Oracle and Teklec running simultaneously and both Oracle and Tekelec are one in the same and share equal amounts of power v.s. (3) Teklec running individually receives funding from Oracle, yet Oracle still does not run any part of the company.
   [//]: # (   The spectrum of this dimension starts from (1)receiving all traditional funding from a company (where the investors own the company) to (2)receiving partial many money from a traditional source(where there is an equal balance of income and power in the company) to (3)having no connections to other companies and being completely self sustaining.)

### Quality of Life
#### Crunch
   
   Crunch defines the time period before a shipping of a project where the developers are expected to work long hours. 
   The length of the crunch varies across product. Extended crunches often lead to "Death Marches" where developers are too tired to produce quality code.

#### Job Stability
	
   Job stability is something that is very important in today's society. As developers are humans and have families and lifestyles to support, it becomes more evident that job stability is valued. Across different industries, developers can expect a varied time period to be employed. Some industried have an expected risk associated with them, which often attracts employees.
   
#### Turnover
   	
   Developers can easily get fed up with the work envrionments. This can cause them to leave their companies at high rates after staying at the company for a short amount of time resulting in high turnover. Low turnover can be defined as high retention rates for the company.
