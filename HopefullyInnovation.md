### Abstract
—In this paper, we present the findings of an interview
study that was conducted in 2009, which collected data on three
major game industry conferences. The study indicates a rise of
instrumentalist views within the game industry parallel to
personal, more artistic views. Processes are seen more and more
as a matter of control rather than as “creative chaos.” This view
is not universally shared, however, as some see great potential in
tools and methods for innovation, while others still look at game
development as a rather organic and uncontrollable process. The
views towards innovation show also other differences. In this
paper we describe seven different attitude profiles that reflect the
different categories of interviewee attitudes toward innovation in
the game industry. Those profiles are artists, universalists,
followers, evangelists, nihilists, instrumentalists, and scarecrows.
