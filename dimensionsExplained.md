    * agile process vs waterfall process

    * process vs no process
        * Does the team follow a process or just develop ad-hoc?
    * entertainment vs solves problem
        * Does the product entertain or does it solve a problem?
    * high dev interaction vs low dev interaction
        * Do developers interact with the rest of the team a lot or a little?
    * creative vs constructive
        * Is this product a new idea or was it constructed from existing ideas?
    * unit tests vs system tests
        * Does the team do more unit tests or more system tests?
    * creativity vs features
        * Does the team value creative desire more or implemented features more?
        * Denae& Anthony: Requirement volatility
    * user challenge vs lack of user challenge
        * Did the team construct this product while thinking about how challenging this would be for the user?
    * user emotion vs lack of user emotion
        * Did the team construct this product while thinking about how users would feel while using this product?
    * user fun vs lack of use fun
        * Did the team construct this product while thinking about how much fun users would have while using this product?
    * mult-discipline teams vs single-discipline teams
        * Does the team consist of lots of different roles (like a developer and an artist on the same team) or do all members of the team have similar roles (like all software developers)
    * user engagement vs lack of user engagement
        * Did the team construct this product while thinking about how much engaged users would be while using this product?
    * documentation vs no documentation
        * Did the paper talk about using documentation to build the product?
    * team composition
        * Is the team composition flexible or concrete?  Can people freely move between teams or are teams unable to move?

        * do team members feel like the product makes a significant impact on their users or not?
    * testing
        * Did this paper talk about software testing or not?

        * did the paper talk about the benefits of crunch or the disadvantages of crunch?
    * social interaction
        * Does the product involve users interacting with each other?
    * company size
        * small company or large company?
    * case study vs empirical data
        * Did this paper support their argument with specific case studies or with more generalizable empirical data?
    * indies vs publisher
    * funding
        * Was the product funded traditionally (contract deal like with publishers, self-funded) or with crowdfunding?
    * medium games vs large games
    * high job stability vs low job stability
      * Consistent and expected long term job v.s.  expecting a short term job
    * high turnover vs low turnover
      * High will be people fed up with the job and leaving vs. people deciding to stay and enjoy working at the company. Less likely to leave.
    * high work ownership vs. low work ownership
      * Ownership here means accountability and responsibility, not dictatorship. Having your name associated with the product.
      * Anthony & Denae: Keep name as 'ownership' reference c.ymcdn.com paper

## Challenges from Grid v1

    * indie devs vs AAA devs
        * duplicate of company size?
    * indies vs publisher
        * rename to contract deal?
        * Denae - I would explain this as is as who large companies report to and who small companies talk to
        * Anthony - replies and says that this should be combined with organizational hierarchy (double tiers)?
        * this covers indies and publishers as well as some traditional software deals as well
    * medium games vs large games
        * rename to size of product?
        * Not just games, but also normal software

## Dimensions from Grid v2

* Requirement Volatility
   - Combiness agile waterfal & creativity- features & process - no process
   
* User Interactions
   - user challenge & user emotion & user fun & user engagement & user impact
   - social interaction - Could be posed as a question at the end of the section.
      - changed the way people game. the game continues to be played even when a specific user is missing. the same way conversations continue when someone leaves.
   - Anthony has official quote somewhere
   
* Testing
 - unit testing vs system testing & is there testing vs.no testing
 - can be defined overall do they have a lot of testing or just a little bit. What kind?
 
* Motivation
   - combines entertainmen-solve problem dimension
   - could also mention a bit of the user impact dimension
   - what is the game for: entertainment or to solve problem and how does that effect the developer's interest?
   - people are interested in the art of creating games just as they are interested in the are of creating computer programs.
   
* Creative v.s. Constructive
   - keep same

* Team composition
   - combine: high dev interaction vs low dev interaction  & team composition(team member movement aka "Anthony calls it viscosity") & multiple discipline teams vs individual discipline teams
   - also add organizational hierarchy: discuss it as close to fluid team movement. Fluid management

* Funding
   - traditional funding() vs crowdfunding
   - spectrum: 1 receiving funding from company .........3 partial crowdfunding...........5 raising money on own
   - Possibly add another one underthis: how responsible/accountable the company is for its product
      - ex. (1) oracle buying all of teklec and running teklec as oracle vs. (2)oracle and teklec running simultaneously and the name are one in the same vs. (3)Teklec living their life and happen to get funding from Oracle. Oracle still does not run any part of the show.
   
* Crunch
   
* Job Stability
   
* Turnover
   
* Work Ownership

* Size
   -  Number of Developers working on Product 
   -  Complexity of Product: How many features does it have?
   -  Number of Users: How many users does a product?
