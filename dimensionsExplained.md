        * Is this product a new idea or was it constructed from existing ideas?
    * unit tests vs system tests
        * Does the team do more unit tests or more system tests?

        * Denae& Anthony: Requirement volatility
    * user challenge vs lack of user challenge
        * Did the team construct this product while thinking about how challenging this would be for the user?
    * user emotion vs lack of user emotion

    * mult-discipline teams vs single-discipline teams
        * Does the team consist of lots of different roles (like a developer and an artist on the same team) or do all members of the team have similar roles (like all software developers)
    * user engagement vs lack of user engagement
        * Did the team construct this product while thinking about how much engaged users would be while using this product?
    * documentation vs no documentation
        * Did the paper talk about using documentation to build the product?
    * team composition
        * Is the team composition flexible or concrete?  Can people freely move between teams or are teams unable to move?
    * organizational hierarchy
        * Is the organization flat or tiered?
    * indie devs vs AAA devs
    * user impact vs no user impact
        * do team members feel like the product makes a significant impact on their users or not?
    * testing
        * Did this paper talk about software testing or not?
    * crunch
        * did the paper talk about the benefits of crunch or the disadvantages of crunch?
    * social interaction
        * Does the product involve users interacting with each other?
    * company size
        * small company or large company?
    * case study vs empirical data
        * Did this paper support their argument with specific case studies or with more generalizable empirical data?
    * indies vs publisher
    * funding
        * Was the product funded traditionally (contract deal like with publishers, self-funded) or with crowdfunding?
    * medium games vs large games
    * high job stability vs low job stability
      * Consistent and expected long term job v.s.  expecting a short term job
    * high turnover vs low turnover
      * High will be people fed up with the job and leaving vs. people deciding to stay and enjoy working at the company. Less likely to leave.
    * high work ownership vs. low work ownership
      * Ownership here means accountability and responsibility, not dictatorship. Having your name associated with the product.
      * Anthony & Denae: Keep name as 'ownership' reference c.ymcdn.com paper

## Challenges

    * indie devs vs AAA devs
        * duplicate of company size?
    * indies vs publisher
        * rename to contract deal?
        * Denae - I would explain this as is as who large companies report to and who small companies
        * Anthony - replies and says that this should be combined with organizational hierarchy (double tiers)?
        * this covers indies and publishers as well as some traditional software deals as well
    * medium games vs large games
        * rename to size of product?
        * Not just games, but also normal software

## Dimensions Combined:

* Requirement Volatility
   - Combiness agile waterfal & creativity- features & process - no process
*
