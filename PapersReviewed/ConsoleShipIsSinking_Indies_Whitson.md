The ‘Console Ship is Sinking’ and What this Means for Indies
===
 
 Author:  Jennifer R. Whitson

## Abstract
Console development is rarely kind to developers. It is an unsustainable paradigm wherein the quests for profits predominate, production is streamlined and rationalized, and the creative process of developers is greatly curtailed in order to maintain shrinking profit margins. Development studios are the creative force behind games. They conceptualize, design, and code our spaces of play. But in the larger chain of the console industry, they are a small cog in a rationalized production cycle, occupying a subservient position in contrast to publishers and manufacturers, and bargaining from an undesirable negotiating position. Because of their passion for games, developers are often willing to overlook working conditions that are less than ideal, profit models that benefit those that sell and market games rather than those that create them, and contracts that stifle creativity in favour of less risky clones and more profitable sequels. However, there is a breaking point for every dedicated developer, and with the growth of social and mobile distribution platforms, there seem to be more indie "escape routes" than ever before. This article outlines the constraints of console development as well as the promises of social and mobile games, ultimately detailing what this means for indie developers as well as academics. 

## Notes
 the game industry is currently experiencing a massive shift: moving from a predominately single-stream economic model dependent on retail PC and console games, to a more diverse economic landscape enabled by online connectivity and digital distribution.

  With the paradigm shifts introduced by new development models, indies have been liberated from console development only to become refugees in social and mobile development

 According to veteran game developer Brian Fargo: “...10 years ago, you could make retail games for $2 or $3 million. Four million dollars wasn't a big deal. Now with these goods, these things can [cost] $100 million. It's made publishers crazy. Whole careers are on the line. Whole companies are on the line. Creating products creates this intense pressure.” 

 To be blunt, out of every twenty-five games that start production, only one will be profitable

this costs publishers more -> more risk -> squeeze devs more

  A 2010 survey of 2,630 game developers found that, on average, developers spent over thirteen weeks a year in crunch mode (Remo, 2010). This meant that during crunch periods, developers worked on average over 55 hours per week, the equivalent of about five extra eight-hour, five-day work weeks per calendar year

social/mobile gaming might be less intense than AAA (not sure if still true now that we essentially have AAA mobile games)

 Most indies speak the language of traditional development sectors, sharing a love of games and many of the same values of console and PC developers. They just may not share the vision of what creates a successful game (e.g. disdaining 'selling out', or working as a cog in a massive team).

indies have a hard time getting games out because of 'gatekeepers' of quality for distribution channels.

hard to get exposure for indie mobile games 

 Instead of chasing AAA studios and attempting to gain access to a game sector that couldn’t care less about what Game Studies can offer them, we should instead be chasing indies. We have the ability to help shore up their life rafts, and – if we do this right – help build the battleships they need in order to survive, and even prosper 

 Indies, unlike AAA, actually want our help 

how can we (researchers) help?

    * talk to indies where they are (meet-ups, game jams, dev conferences)
    * understand their needs and desires
    * seek to meet those needs and desires
