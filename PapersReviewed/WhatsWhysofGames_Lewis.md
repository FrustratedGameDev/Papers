Title: The whats and the whys of games and software engineering

Authors: Chris Lewis, Jim Whitehead

Abstract:

The intersection of video games and software engineering is not yet well understood. This paper highlights the varied and exciting opportunities available at the intersection of these two disciplines. We investigate four main areas: the development of games, how they are designed, how middleware supports the creative process and how games are tested. We hope that it inspires readers to take on the challenges available in games and software engineering, and join together to create a vibrant community.
