Develop: Double Fine's Schafer On 'Amnesia Fortnights' And The Pitfalls Of AAA
===

By Simon Parkin

## Notes
- moving away from AAA to something less high-risk
- talked about splitting the studio into smaller teams to each come up with a prototype for a possible game.
- these four demos gave a morale boost
- AAA game was cancelled by EA - fell back to one of the demos, Amnesia Fortnight
- did multiple smaller, cheaper games rather than a huge expensive game. This made the risk lower since a failure from one game wouldn't bring down the company.
- AAA publishers want to make the game safe, whereas developers want to do something "daring or experimental"

## Dimension
medium games vs large games.
