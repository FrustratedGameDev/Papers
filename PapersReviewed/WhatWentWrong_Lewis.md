Title: What went wrong: a taxonomy of video game bugs

Authors: Chris Lewis, Jim Whitehead, Noah Wardrip-Fruin

Abstract: 

Video games are complex, emergent systems that are difficult to design and test. This difficulty invariably leads to failures being present in the game, negatively impacting the play experience of some. We present a taxonomy of possible failures, divided into temporal and non-temporal failures. The taxonomy can guide the thinking of designers and testers alike, helping them expose bugs in the game. This will lead to games being better tested and designed, with fewer failures when released.
