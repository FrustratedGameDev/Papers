### Abstract
In software engineering (SE), video game development is unique yet similar to other software endeavors. It is unique in that it combines the work of teams covering multiple disciplines (art, music, acting, programming, etc.), and that engaging game play is sought after through the use of prototypes and iterations. With that, game development is faced with challenges that can be addressed using traditional SE practices. The industry needs to adopt sound SE practices for their distinct needs such as managing multimedia assets and finding the ldquofunrdquo in game play. The industry must take on the challenges by evolving SE methods to meet their needs. This work investigates these challenges and highlights engineering practices to mitigate these challenges.

## Dimensions
