#CS 510 Final Report Outline

##Goals

##Introduction

- Compare Software Development to Games Development
- Discuss ultimate findings in performing a RepGrid Analysis
- 	What repgrid are usually used for and 

##Background

- Talk about examples menzies provided of RepGrid
- Discuss the history of Software Development to Game Development

##Methodology

- How we determined seed papers
- How we determined relevant papers
	- What are the relevancy rules.
- Defining Key Articles

### Determing Refining Process
- Labeling process
	- Revising labels
	- Which ones were used often, which were not, and why?
- Discuss the process for adding a dimension to the grid
- Discuss the process of merging dimension on the grid

### Repertory Grid Tools
- Tools we used to build the repgrid
	- Repgrid tool v.s. excel
	- how we used the tool( Cluster analysis)

##Results

- Determining Weight
- Ranking Dimensions
- Determining Rank (Frequency or Importance)
- Show the final Paper Comparison Grid
- Show the final Developer Comparison Grid

###Dimensions Defined
- List all of the combined dimensions in the final rep grid.

##Discussion
 - Discuss implications of grid 
 - What are people going to do with this information provide.
 
##Conclusion

- What does the repgrid provide for the research community
- What are the next steps to a study 

##Future Work

##References
- Add all the papers from the large cluster analysis repgrid  FinalRepGrid03223_02.svg
- Add papers that discussed what a repgrid is.
